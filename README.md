# TetraPS

A collection of PowerShell scripts created by TetraTheta.  
Each directory has its own README file, so see the corresponding README file for a detailed description.

Some of the scripts are no longer functioning or contain old code. This is because the script is no longer in use and has not been updated. These scripts can be updated when used again in the future.
